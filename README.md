<p align="center">Exact Computations with Real Numbers</p>
<hr>

exact-real is a C++/Python library which provides exact lazy computations in the Real Numbers. In particular it implements arithmetic and comparisons of (random) transcendental numbers.

Source tarballs can be downloaded at https://github.com/flatsurf/exact-real/releases.

This repository contains two related projects:

* **libexactreal** a C++ library
* **pyexactreal** a Python wrapper for **libexactreal**

## Build from the Source Code Repository or a Tarball

If you have cloned the source directory you will need to setup the
configure script and Makefile using autotools. That is

    git submodule update --init
    ./bootstrap

If you obtained a tarball of the sources or if the preceding step
worked, you just have to do

    ./configure
    make
    make check  # to run our test suite
    make install  # to install into /usr/local

If you happen to have any of the dependencies installed in a non-standard
directory, you will have to specify the `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` variables for
the configure script

    ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/my/path/include LDFLAGS=-L/my/path/lib

For best performance run `CXXFLAGS="-O3 -flto -march=native -mtune=native"
CXX="g++ -fno-semantic-interposition" ./configure` instead of `./configure` as
this code greatly benefits from flto inlining. (Unfortunately, libtool filters
out `-fno-semantic-interposition` as of early 2019 so we can not pass it as
part of `CXXFLAGS`. If you are using clang, `-fno-semantic-interposition` does
not seem to be necessary.) Do not use `-Ofast` or `-ffast-math` as parts of our
code rely on IEEE compliance. You might want to add `-g3` to the `CXXFLAGS`
which does not hurt performance but gives a better debugging experience. For
the best debugging experience, you might want to replace `-O3` with `-Og` or
even `-O0` but the latter results in very poor performance.

If your compiler supports it, you can try to add `-fvisibility=hidden
-fvisibility-inlines-hidden` to your `CXXFLAGS`. This hides internal bits in
the resulting library which have lead to crashes in the past due to conflicting
header-only libraries.

If your linker supports it, you should use `./configure --with-version-script`
to shrink the resulting shared library to an exact curated list of versioned
symbols.

Additionally, you might want to run configure with ` --disable-static` which
improves the build time.

[perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) works well to profile
when you make sure that `CXXFLAGS` contains `-fno-omit-frame-pointer`. You can
then for example run our test suite with `perf record --call-graph dwarf make
check`. Apart from perf itself there are several ways to analyze the output,
[hotspot](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot) might be the most convenient one at
the time of this writing.

## Installation

The preferred way to install exact-real is to use your package manager (e.g.
`apt-get` on Debian or Ubuntu, `pacman` on Arch Linux, `brew` on MacOS, etc).
You can use [repology for
libexactreal](https://repology.org/project/libexactreal/packages) and for
[pyexactreal](https://repology.org/project/pyexactreal/packages) to see if
exact-real is already available for your system. Note that there is an
unrelated [package for Haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/exact-real)
by the same name.

Otherwise, you can build and install this package from source (as outlined
above) or install it with conda.
Download and install
[Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge), then run

```
mamba create -n exactreal libexactreal pyexactreal
conda activate exactreal
```

## Run with binder in the Cloud

You can try out the projects in this repository in a very limited environment
online by clicking the following links:

* **libexactreal** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flatsurf/exact-real/2.1.0?filepath=binder%2FSample.libexactreal.ipynb) (might not work currently, due to [a bug in xeus-cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/issues/413))
* **pyexactreal** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flatsurf/exact-real/2.2.0?filepath=binder%2FSample.pyexactreal.ipynb)

## Build with conda-forge Dependencies

To build all of exact-real, you need a fairly recent C++ compiler and probably
some packages that might not be readily available on your system. If you don't
want to use your distribution's packages, you can use these dependencies from
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org). Download and install
[Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge), then run

    mamba create -n exact-real-build ccache
    mamba env update -n exact-real-build -f libexactreal/environment.yml
    mamba env update -n exact-real-build -f pyexactreal/environment.yml
    conda activate exact-real-build
    export CC="ccache cc"  # to speed up future compilation
    export CXX="ccache c++"  # to speed up future compilation
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/flatsurf/exact-real.git
    cd exact-real
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --prefix="$CONDA_PREFIX"
    make
    make check  # to run our test suite

## Run Tests and Benchmark

`make check` runs all tests and benchmarks. During development `make check TESTS=module`
only runs the tests for `module`. Note that the environment variable
`EXACTREAL_CHECK` is passed on to the tests and benchmarks, i.e., you could add
`EXACTREAL_CHECK="--benchmark_min_time=.02"` to not let the benchmarks run as
long as they would usually.
