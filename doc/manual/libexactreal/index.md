# exact-real: Exact Computations with Real Numbers

exact-real is a C++ library for exact computation with real numbers. More
specifically, it implements arithmetic with elements of modules over rings such
as number fields, generated by (computable and often transcendental) real
numbers.

This C++ library is built on top of [FLINT](https://flintlib.org/),
[Arb](https://fredrikj.net/arb/) and
[e-antic](https://github.com/flatsurft/e-antic).

The arithmetic that exact-real can perform is currently somewhat limited. The
original aim was to provide fast arithmetic for computations in translations
surfaces for [flatsurf](https://github.com/flatsurf/flatsurf).

The development of exact-real is coordinated on
[github](https://github.com/flatsurf/exact-real). Contributions such as [ideas, bug
reports](https://github.com/flatsurf/exact-real/issues), or [code
changes](https://github.com/flatsurf/exact-real/pulls) are always very welcome.

## Installation

The preferred way to install exact-real is to use your package manager (e.g.
`apt-get` on Debian or Ubuntu, `pacman` on Arch Linux, `brew` on MacOS, etc).
See [repology for exact-real](https://repology.org/project/libexactreal/packages).

Note that exact-real is usually packaged as `libexactreal`, the C++ library and
`pyexactreal` its Python interface. There is also a Haskell package called
exact-real that is unrelated to this project.

The following describe alternative ways of installing exact-real.

* [Install with Conda](install_in_conda)
* [Build from Source](https://github.com/flatsurf/exact-real/#build-from-the-source-code-repository-or-a-tarball)
* [Conda Environment to Build from Source](https://github.com/flatsurf/exact-real/#build-with-conda-dependencies)

## Python Interface

The Python interface relies on [cppyy](https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
exposing automatic bindings to the C++ interface. The documentation of the
Python interface can be found [here](/exact-real/pyexactreal).
