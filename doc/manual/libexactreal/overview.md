# Overview of the C++ Interface

There are two main objects in exact-real. Modules, defined in
[exact-real/module.hpp](), and their elements, defined in [exact-real/element.hpp]().

To work with exact-real, you first need to select a coefficient ring over which
your module will live. Currently implemented are the [ring of integers](<>
"exactreal::IntegerRing"), the [field of rationals](<>
"exactreal::RationalField"), and real-embedded [number fields](<> "exactreal::NumberField").

To create a module over this coefficient ring, you need to select generators
for your module. The most important such generators are a fixed [rational
number](<> "exactreal::RealNumber::rational") such as 1 and [random
transcendental numbers](<> "exactreal::RealNumber::random").

Once a coefficient ring and the generators have been selected, elements can be created and arithmetic with them can be performed.

## Example

We want to construct a module over the field of rational real numbers.  We
include the required headers and create our coefficient ring:

```cpp
#include <exact-real/rational_field.hpp>
#include <exact-real/real_number.hpp>
#include <exact-real/module.hpp>
#include <exact-real/element.hpp>

exactreal::RationalField Q;
```

We fix our generators, one is a [random real number](<>
"exactreal::RealNumber::random") in the interval (0, 1).

```cpp
auto a = exactreal::RealNumber::rational(1);
auto b = exactreal::RealNumber::random();
```

We construct the [module](<> "exactreal::Module") generated by these reals:

```cpp
auto M = exactreal::Module::make({a, b}, Q);
```

We construct some [elements](<> "exactreal::Element") in this module, namely its [generators](<> "exactreal::Module::gen"):
```cpp
auto x = M.gen(0);
auto y = M.gen(1);
```

We perform some arithmetic in this module:

```cpp
std::cout << 2*x;
// -> ...

y + x - y == x
// -> true
```

Note that we can also [multiply elements](<>
"exactreal::Element::operator*="), however the result then typically lives in
a larger module:

```cpp
(y * y).module() == M
// -> false
```

[Divisions](<> "exactreal::Element::truediv") are supported when the
result can be determined exactly:

```cpp
(y * y).truediv(y) == y
// -> true
```

Otherwise, only [floor division](<> "exactreal::Element::floordiv") is possible:

```cpp
x.floordiv(y) >= 1
// -> true
```
