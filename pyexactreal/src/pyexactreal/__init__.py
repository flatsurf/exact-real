Python and SageMath wrappers for libexactreal

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from pyexactreal import RealNumber  # random output by cppyy on macOS if xcode is not installed
    >>> x = RealNumber.random()
    >>> x
    ℝ(0.303644…)

A module over the integers::

    >>> from pyexactreal import ZZModule
    >>> ZM = ZZModule(RealNumber.rational(1), RealNumber.random()); ZM
    ℤ-Module(1, ℝ(0.120809…))

A module over the rationals::

    >>> from pyexactreal import QQModule
    >>> QM = QQModule(RealNumber.rational(1), RealNumber.random(1)); QM
    ℚ-Module(1, ℝ(1=9223372036854776177p-63 + ℝ(0.178808…)p-64))

A module over a number field::

    >>> from pyexactreal import NumberFieldModule, NumberField
    >>> K = NumberField("x^2 - 2", "x", "1.4 +/- 1")
    >>> KM = NumberFieldModule(K, RealNumber.rational(1), RealNumber.random()); KM
    K-Module(1, ℝ(0.478968…))

TESTS:

A random number can be pickled and unpickled::

    >>> from pickle import loads, dumps
    >>> loads(dumps(x)) == x
    True

Modules and their elements can be pickled and unpickled::

    >>> loads(dumps(ZM)) == ZM
    True
    >>> loads(dumps(ZM.gen(0))) == ZM.gen(0)
    True
    >>> loads(dumps(QM)) == QM
    True
    >>> loads(dumps(QM.gen(0))) == QM.gen(0)
    True
    >>> loads(dumps(KM)) == KM
    True
    >>> loads(dumps(KM.gen(0))) == KM.gen(0)
    True

    The Real Numbers as a module over the real embedded number field ``base``.

    This parent wraps the finitely generated modules provided by the
    exact-real package for SageMath. Elements in this parent are typically
    linear combinations of some particular real numbers such as transcendental
    random reals.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from pyexactreal import ExactReals
        sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2, embedding=AA(sqrt(2)))
        sage: R = ExactReals(K)
        sage: o = R.rational(1); o
        1

    A random real number, i.e., a number whose digits are provided by a
    (pseudo) random number generator. Due to the periodicity of the random
    number generator, this is technically not a transcendental number. However,
    it can be used to model one for all practical purposes::

        sage: g = R.random_element(); g
        ℝ(0.782515…)
        sage: a * g
        (a ~ 1.41421...)*ℝ(0.782515…)
        sage: g + o
        ℝ(0.782515…) + 1
        sage: a + g
        ℝ(0.782515…) + (a ~ 1.41421...)

    Internally, elements live in different modules, generated by the generators
    their built from. However, you won't see any of that underlying machinery
    as these modules get constructed automatically as required::

        sage: g*g + g + a
        ℝ(0.782515…)^2 + ℝ(0.782515…) + (a ~ 1.41421...)

    Basic arithmetic is supported, though some operations, such as divisions,
    only work in special cases::

        sage: g / 10
        (1/10 ~ 0.10000...)*ℝ(0.782515…)
        sage: g / g
        1
        sage: R.random_element() / R.random_element()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        pyexactreal.cppyy_exactreal.NotRepresentableError: ...

    Comparisons should work without limitations. The underlying exact-real
    compares ball-arithmetic representation, going to higher precisions as
    necessary. Due to the nature of the numbers that are supported, this
    process is always guaranteed to terminate::

        sage: g > g
        False
        sage: g < 1
        True
        sage: g*g < g
        True
        sage: g + o == o + g
        True
